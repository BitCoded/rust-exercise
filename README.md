# Hello World (Rust)

This exercise requires you to return some text from the `hello` function.

Return a `String` containing the following text:

```
Hello, World!
```

> Hint 1: most of the code is already present. You simply need to add one line inside the `hello` function!  
> Hint 2: You will need to convert the literal (`&str`) to a `String` using the `.to_string()` method, or the `String::from()` function.

## Running the tests

When you think you're ready, test your code by running the following command:

``` sh
cargo test
```

If your program is correct, you shouldn't get any errors.
